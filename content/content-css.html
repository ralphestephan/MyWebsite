    <!-- History of the Web Section -->
    <h2 id="history">History of the World Wide Web</h2>
    <p>The World Wide Web (WWW) was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while working at CERN. The web was initially designed as a system to share and access information through interconnected hypertext documents. The first website was launched in 1991. Over time, the web evolved, introducing multimedia, e-commerce, social media platforms, and cloud computing.</p>

    <p><strong>Current Trends:</strong> The web today is characterized by the rise of Web 3.0, artificial intelligence, and decentralized applications (dApps). There is also a focus on privacy-enhancing technologies such as encryption and blockchain.</p>
    <p><strong>Future Possibilities:</strong> The future of the web might include more immersive technologies such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and the Metaverse, which seeks to integrate real-world and digital interactions more seamlessly.</p>
    <p><strong>Browser History:</strong> The earliest web browsers include Mosaic (1993) and Netscape Navigator (1994), which paved the way for modern browsers like Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge.</p>

    <!-- Security Issues Section -->
    <h2 id="security">Security Issues on the Web</h2>
    <p>The World Wide Web faces numerous security issues, including phishing attacks, malware, data breaches, and denial-of-service attacks. The rise of social engineering and ransomware also poses significant threats to both individuals and organizations.</p>
